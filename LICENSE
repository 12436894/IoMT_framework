This project builds a hybrid machine learning model by combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers into a Voting Classifier. The model predicts labels from a given dataset and provides detailed graphical visualizations of the results. All outputs (evaluation reports, plots, datasets) are saved into an output/ directory.
